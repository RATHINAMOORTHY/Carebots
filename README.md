DESCRIPTION:
A carebot is a robot dedicated to personal healthcare. Hiring a professional for
personal healthcare is not feasible to everyone. The professional caretakers
may not be able to serve the patient in person all the times due to their
personal work and other reasons. The carebots can travel with the person
anytime. The elderly care is becoming a crisis in India as the ratio between
elderly people and professional caretakers is very low. A humanoid robot can
assist the professionals in personal healthcare and also serve individually.
The carebots are the key to solve this crisis because the cost of operation is
very low and the chance of error is relatively low. 


 ARM processors are more power efficient and
modern Machine Learning Algorithms can be implemented easily on these
processors. The actuators such as servomotors and other control systems can be
interfaced with the processor.
